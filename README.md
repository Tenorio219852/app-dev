## Heartstopper Series/2022
>The story of two British teens, Nick Nelson and Charlie Spring, at an all-boys grammar school. Charlie, a high-strung, openly gay overthinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, one day are made to sit together in class. Their friendship quickly becomes something more for openly gay Charlie, but he initially does not believe he has a chance with Nick, but love works in surprising ways, with Nick more interested in Charlie than either of them realized. Heartstopper is about love, friendship, and loyalty. It encompasses all the small stories of Nick and Charlie's lives that together make something larger. Charlie and Nick attend the same school but never meet until the day they're made to sit together. They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, although he doesn't think he has a chance. Love works in more surprising ways, with Nick more interested in Charlie than either of them realize.
